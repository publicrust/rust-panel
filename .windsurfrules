### Project Overview: Rust-Panel

**Goal:**  
Develop an open, secure, and user-friendly server management panel offering data encryption, blockchain-based authentication, and an extensible architecture.

**Problem Statement:**  
Current hosting solutions often:  
- Store user data unencrypted, making it vulnerable.  
- Lack transparency about access to user files.  
- Restrict customization and extension of hosting panels.  

**Solution:**  
Rust-Panel will:  
- Encrypt all server data with owner-only access.  
- Be fully open-source for transparency.  
- Support plugins, templates, and blockchain integration.

## 1. Backend (C#)

### Core Tasks:
#### Basic API Framework:
- Build a **RESTful API** using **ASP.NET Core** for server management.
- Enable interaction with file systems and processes (e.g., file operations, process controls).

#### Authentication:
- Implement login/password authentication with hashing (**bcrypt** or similar).
- Support blockchain-based login (TON/ETH):  
  - Token generation.  
  - Digital signature verification.  

#### Data Encryption:
- Create a module for generating unique keys per server instance.
- Implement on-the-fly file encryption/decryption and encrypted log storage.

#### Server Management:
- Start, stop, and restart server processes.
- Command input via **WebSocket** or **SignalR** for real-time terminal interaction.
- Log stdout/stderr for server processes.

#### File Manager API:
- Provide CRUD operations for file management (e.g., upload, delete, edit).
- Add support for encrypted directories.

#### Plugin System:
- Design an API for extensions, supporting templates and additional modules.

## 2. Frontend (React)

### Core Tasks:
#### Application Structure:
- Set up a React project with routing using **React Router**.
- Implement global state management using **Redux** or Context API.

#### Authentication:
- Create a login form for username/password.
- Add blockchain-based login (TON/ETH) with key storage.

#### Dashboard:
- Display server information (status, actions: start, stop, restart).
- Integrate real-time server logs using **WebSocket** or **SignalR**.

#### File Manager:
- Build an interface for file management: upload, delete, and edit files.
- Show encryption/decryption process status.

#### Extensions Marketplace:
- Add a marketplace for templates and plugins.
- Allow users to install and manage custom add-ons.

---

## 3. General Tasks:

### Documentation:
- Generate API documentation (e.g., **Swagger**, **Postman** collections).
- Write guides for installation, configuration, and usage (ReadMe, Wiki).

### Git Workflow:
- Use Git Flow for versioning.
- Separate branches: `main`, `develop`, and `feature`.

### Security:
- Add brute-force protection for login attempts.
- Perform regular static code analysis for vulnerabilities.

---

## Development Roadmap:

### MVP:
- Implement core server management functions (start/stop/restart, terminal).
- Add basic encryption and terminal interaction.
- Basic authentication (login/password).

### Blockchain Integration:
- Support TON/ETH authentication with token and signature validation.
- Provide decentralized key storage (no hosting involvement).

### Extension Support:
- Develop a marketplace for plugins and templates.
- Allow interface and functionality customization.

### Infrastructure Expansion:
- Add cluster and load balancing support.
- Enable FTP access with two-factor authentication (2FA).

Rust-Panel is designed to address critical security and transparency gaps in hosting panels. Its open-source nature fosters community-driven development while prioritizing user control and ease of use.

We welcome contributions from developers to create the next generation of secure, extensible hosting solutions.
